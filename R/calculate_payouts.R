#' A function to calculate payouts for RICH economic games using the compiled edgelists
#'
#' This function allows you to quickly calculate payouts. See details below. Note that coins allocated to alters who do not themselves appear as focals are refunded to the donors.
#' @param 
#' path Full path to main folder.
#' @param 
#' pattern File extension of photos. Should be ".jpg" or ".JPG". 
#' @param 
#' start Location of start of PID in file name. If files are saved as "XXX.jpg" for example, this is 1.
#' @param 
#' stop Location of end of PID in file name. If files are saved as "XXX.jpg" for example, this is 3.
#' @param 
#' game Indicates which game data will be used in payout calculations. All combinations of G for the giving/allocation game, L for the leaving/taking game, and
#' R for the reduction/punishment game, are accepted: i.e., type "G", "L", "R", "GL", "GR", "LR", or "GLR".
#' @param 
#' GV Value of coins used in giving game.
#' @param 
#' LV Value of coins used in leaving game.
#' @param 
#' KV Value of coins kept in reducing game.
#' @param 
#' RV Value of punishment tokens used in reducing game. Should be negative.
