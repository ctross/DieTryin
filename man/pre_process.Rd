\title{A helper function to streamline pre-processing workflow}
\usage{
pre_process(
  path,
  ID,
  game = "Blank",
  panels = c("A", "B"),
  pre_processed = FALSE,
  automate = FALSE,
  reference = NULL,
  d_x = 20,
  d_y = 20
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Full path to main folder.}

\item{ID}{Unique ID of focal individual/respondent.}

\item{game}{ID for case/game/question.}

\item{panels}{ID codes used to distinguish photographs of the different boards/panels/frames from the same person and game.}

\item{pre_processed}{Are photographs pre-processed such that image correction steps can be skipped? If FALSE, then user must pre-process images using DieTryings tools. If TRUE game board photographs must be cropped and unskewed. 
Some Android and IOS apps, like Tiny Scanner, provide a means of producing such photographs of the game boards at the time of data collection.}

\item{automate}{will corners be selected manually, or automatically?}

\item{reference}{path to the reference set.}

\item{d_x}{x width of kernel used to scan for corners}

\item{d_y}{y width of kernel used to scan for corners}
}
\value{
A list of length 2. The first slot contains image files. The second slot contains the locations of game-board corners.
}
\description{
This function is used to prepare data for automatic coding.

filled = vector("list", 26)
filled[[1]] = pre_process(path=path, ID="QQQ", game="Blank", panels=c("A","B"))
