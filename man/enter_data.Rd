\title{A function to enter manually data from RICH economic games}
\usage{
enter_data(
  path = path,
  pattern = ".jpg",
  start = 1,
  stop = 3,
  n_panels = 4,
  n_rows = 5,
  n_cols = 8,
  seed = 1,
  ordered = NULL,
  add = c("Nothing")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Full path to main folder.}

\item{pattern}{File extension of photos. Should be ".jpg" or ".JPG".}

\item{start}{Location of start of PID in file name. If files are saved as "XXX.jpg" for example, this is 1.}

\item{stop}{Location of end of PID in file name. If files are saved as "XXX.jpg" for example, this is 3.}

\item{n_panels}{Number of frames/panels/blocks of photos to be output. I use four big panels and randomize order at each game.}

\item{n_rows}{Number of rows per panel. With 7cm x 10cm photos, I use five rows of photos per panel.}

\item{n_cols}{Number of rows per panel. With 7cm x 10cm photos, I use six to eight cols of photos per panel.}

\item{seed}{A seed for the random number generator to sort the order of photos in the array. This should match the seed used to make the survey.}

\item{ordered}{A list of IDs if photograph order is to be explicilty coded. This overwrites random sorting.}

\item{add}{A vector of labels with the same names passed into setup_folders(). Used to save social network data not corresponding to the 3 RICH games.}

\description{
This function allows you to speed up data entry. Simply set a path to the main folder. Then run the function. In the popup, enter "Y" if the data is for a new person, 
and "N" if it is for a second game from the same person. In the header for each data.entry table, you must enter "G"'", "L", or "R" to indicate which game:
Giving, Leaving, or Reducing, the data correspond to. In the function call, set the number of panels, and the number of rows and cols per panel, as in the build_survey file.
