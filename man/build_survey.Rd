\title{A function to build LaTeX survey tool for RICH economic games or related social network data collection}
\usage{
build_survey(
  path,
  pattern = ".jpg",
  start = 1,
  stop = 3,
  n_panels = 4,
  n_rows = 5,
  n_cols = 8,
  seed = 1,
  ordered = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Full path to main folder.}

\item{pattern}{File extension of photos. Should be ".jpg" or ".JPG".}

\item{start}{Location of start of PID in file name. If files are saved as "XXX.jpg" for example, this is 1.}

\item{stop}{Location of end of PID in file name. If files are saved as "XXX.jpg" for example, this is 3.}

\item{n_panels}{Number of frames/panels/blocks of photos to be output. I use four big panels and randomize order at each game.}

\item{n_rows}{Number of rows per panel. With 7cm x 10cm photos, I use five rows of photos per panel.}

\item{n_cols}{Number of cols per panel. With 7cm x 10cm photos, I use six to eight cols of photos per panel.}

\item{seed}{A seed for the random number generator to sort the order of photos in the array.}

\item{ordered}{A list of IDs in explicit order. Can be used to overide random sorting.}
}
\description{
This function allows you to speed up data collection and photo randomization. Simply set a path to the main folder.  
Set the number of panels, and the number of rows and cols per panel. Then run the function. This function relies on 'xtable' to create a survey tool, and compile to PDF using LaTeX.
The user must have a LaTeX build on the system path.
