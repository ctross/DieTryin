}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to RICH folder.}

\item{pattern}{Should "JPG" be "jpg" be used to load photos?}

\item{token_color}{"color" of tokens placed. If data was entered manually, place whatever value was stored 
to indiciate a tie: e.g., "1"}

\item{set_size}{Size of set of possible alters.}

\item{height}{Size of PDF output.}

\item{width}{Size of PDF output.}

\item{seed}{Number to use in seeding the randomizer.}

\item{full_alter_set}{Include all alters on roster, or only those who played first round of game?}

\item{max_iter}{Max time to search for legal permutations.}

\item{gid_size}{Number of characters in hashcodes for the game IDs.}

\item{game_name}{Used to label PDF surveys.}

\item{RID}{ID of researcher.}

\item{day}{Day of interview.}

\item{month}{Month of interview.}

\item{year}{Year of interview.}
}
\value{
A file folder, SubsetSurveys, full of PDFs of subset-surveys to run, and a second folder,
 SubsetContributions, full of CSV files to store results.
}
\description{
This is a small helper function to create suveys (PDFs) to collect data for PGG contributions and similar games.
